<h1>Hypokalemia</h1>

<p>
  <u>Common causes:</u>  Cellular shifts, GI loss, and renal losses.  At night, usually due to diuresis of CHF patients.

<h2>Repletion:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Check the Cr first (the higher the Cr, the less K will be cleared, so K will correct higher than intended).</li>
  <li>Repletion:  Goal is usually >4.0 mmol/L.</li>
  <ul>
  <li>For every 10 mEq of KCL given, the serum level should increase by about 0.1 mmol/L (ex: 40mEq KCL IV should increase the serum K from 3.6 to 4.0 mmol/L).</li>
  <li><b>IV:</b>  More reliable that 10 mEq will raise the K by 0.1mmol/L.  May cause a burning sensation in the peripheral IV.  The max infusion rate is 10mEq/hr through a peripheral, 20mEq/hr through a central line.  </li>
  <li><b>PO:</b>  A little less reliable that 10mEq will increase the serum by 0.1 mmol/L.</li>
</ul>
  <li>To account for an elevated Cr.</li>
<ul>
  <li>Take the amount of K you would like to give and divide by the patient’s Cr to obtain the actual K to infuse.</li>
  <li>Example:  K=3, Cr=2; you would like to give 80mEq of KCL (to get K up to 3.8)</li>
  So: 80mEq/2 = 40mEq is how much KCL should be given
</ul>
  <li>When you replete very low K (for example, K in the 2’s), you can give both IV and PO concurrently.</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Example:  K=2.6, Cr=0.9</li>
  	You can order KCL 40mEq IV x1 and KCL elixir 40mEq PO x1
    </ul>
  <li>DO NOT replete K in dialysis patients.  Their dialysis should correct this.</li>
</ol>
